# LearnNPlay: Reinforcement Learning for Game Playing

Welcome to LearnNPlay, a comprehensive repository dedicated to our Final Year Project (FYP) focused on developing a reinforcement learning (RL) model tailored for mastering various games.

## Overview

LearnNPlay aims to create an efficient learning system capable of excelling in diverse gaming environments through the application of reinforcement learning techniques. Here's a breakdown of the key components and methodologies:

- **Reinforcement Learning Model:** Our project revolves around the development of a robust RL model, designed to enable AI agents to learn from interactions and achieve mastery in gaming scenarios.
  
- **OpenAI Gym Environment:** To facilitate experimentation and provide a standardized platform for testing our RL algorithms, we utilize the OpenAI Gym environment. This versatile toolkit offers a wide range of simulated game scenarios, fostering flexibility and ease-of-use in our development process.

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Algorithm:** At the core of our learning strategy lies the implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Known for its stability and effectiveness in training policies for both continuous and discrete action spaces, PPO serves as the cornerstone for achieving robust learning outcomes in various gaming environments.

- **Stable Baselines Library:** To ensure model stability and flexibility during training, we leverage the Stable Baselines library. Integrated with PyTorch, this powerful toolkit provides high-quality implementations of popular RL algorithms in Python, streamlining the training, evaluation, and deployment processes.
